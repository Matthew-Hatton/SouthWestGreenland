# WestGreenland
The data handling for the parameterisation for StrathE2EPolar model implementation of the South-West of Greenland. This is the project for my PhD.

PhD aim:

To develop a dynamic food web model of the West Greenland marine ecosystem. Such a model is required to enable strategic scenario analyses of fisheries and wildlife conservation measures in the face of warming, melting of the Greenland icecap, and changes in ocean circulation. 
PhD objectives:

My objective is to answer the following questions:  

How will fisheries management reference points for each of the harvested guilds of taxa in the ecosystem (FMSY and BBSY â€“ the fishing mortality and biomass at Maximum Sustainable Yield) change in the future, and what will this mean for indigenous human communities?  
What is the sensitivity of high trophic levels (birds, pinnipeds, cetaceans and maritime mammals) to the indirect (food web mediated) effects of fishing, and how will this be affected by changing environmental conditions? 
 What trade-offs between harvesting and wildlife conservation may emerge as a result of climate change?
